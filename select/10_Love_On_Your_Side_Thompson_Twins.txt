I hear you laughing in some other room
And it makes me feel locked out
You say my passion often stifles you
And you need to move about
But I was taught that boys need girls
And girls need boys
You say that's not true
You would rather fool around than be alone with me
That's all right for you

'Cause you got love, love
Love on your side
'Cause you got love, love
Love on your side
'Cause you got love, love
Love on your side
'Cause you got love, love
Love on your side

I bought you sentimental roses
But you gave them all away
I played you all my favorite records

Then we spend the night in talking
Talking all the time
You send me home
I was so surprised to find that after all
It doesn't hurt to be alone

'Cause you got love, love
Love on your side
'Cause you've got love, love
Love on your side
'Cause you've got love, love
Love on your side
'Cause you've got love, love
Love on your side

Well, all the things you say make perfect sense to me
Somehow, I'm still unsure
Then I catch myself going through the same old rhapsody
(Rap, boy, rap!)
And I don't understand just what I'm doing to myself
I guess that's nothing new
'Cause when you meet someone who doesn't follow all the rules
It changes everything you do

'Cause you've got love, love
Love on your side
You've got love, love
Love on your side
'Cause you got love, love
Love on your side
'Cause you've got love, love
Love on your side

'Cause you've got love, love
Love on your side
'Cause you've got love, love
Love on your side
You got love, love
Love on your side
'Cause you got love, love
Love on your side
'Cause you've got love, love
Love on your side
'Cause you got love, love
Love on your side
'Cause you got love, love
Love on your side
