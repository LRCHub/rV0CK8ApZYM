Holding barely on the streets for a while
Desperately awaiting for the straight dollar sign
Been waiting for the straight dollar sign
Supreme now Im trained for it
Oh, you will never gonna change my mind
You're looking for a straight forward sign
I'm looking for a straight forward sign
I want a sign
You know that I'm on it
Tell you that I love you
Never ever was, only for the straight forward sign
Give me the straight dollar sign
Illusion, illusion, illusion
Illusion, illusion, illusion
Illusion, illusion, illusion
You came to me, you spoke the truth and set us free
But love don't come and go
Now I never wanna see you or look in your eye
Said I'm only the street for a third night
Said I'm only the street for a third night
Are you gonna break down?
Where you wanna scream on the side?
Where you wanna scream and run?
Give me the straight dollar sign
Something about?? I wanna set myself again
The world won't stop, the world won't bear
Looking past the straight forward sign
Sick and humble myself, get to know myself again
Separating my feeling from someone who's straight for herself
And it's all that you know, don't know any more
And enjoy your fear and a warm bed and you working
And you wanna hold my?? on your side
Come on back, say
Down for a second and I'm holding myself.
